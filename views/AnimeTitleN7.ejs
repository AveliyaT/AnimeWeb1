<h3><p><strong>   Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba </strong> (Japanese: 鬼滅の刃, Kimetsu no Yaiba) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Koyoharu Gotouge. It follows teenage Tanjiro Kamado, who strives to become a demon slayer after his family was slaughtered and his younger sister Nezuko turned into a demon.
    It was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from February 2016 to May 2020, with its chapters collected in twenty-three tankōbon volumes. It has been published in English by Viz Media and simultaneously published by Shueisha on their Manga Plus platform.</p>
    <p>In 2006, the Animax channel aired the anime series of the same name, a 26-episode adaptation of the manga created by Bones.</p></h3>

<h2> <em> Setting </em> </h2></h3>

<h3><p><strong> The genres are adventure, dark fantasy, martial arts </strong></p>
<h3><p>   The story takes place in Taishō-era Japan, where a secret society, known as the Demon Slayer Corps, has been waging a secret war against demons for centuries. The demons are former humans who were turned into demons by Muzan injecting them with his own blood, and they feed on humans and possess supernatural
    abilities such as super strength, powers that demons can obtain called "Blood Demon Art ", and regeneration. Demons can only be killed if they're decapitated with weapons crafted from an alloy known as Sun Steel, injected with poison extracted from wisteria flowers, or exposed to sunlight. The Demon Slayers, on
    the other hand, are entirely human; however, they employ special breathing techniques, known as "Breathing Styles", which grant them superhuman strength and increased resistance. This helps increase their chances fighting against demons. </p>
    <p> The second season ran for two consecutive cours; beginning with a television series adaptation of the "Mugen Train" story arc on October 10, 2021. It included an original first episode, as well as new animation cuts and background music that differ from the film adaptation.</p></h3>

    <h2><em>Plot</em></h2>
<h3><p><strong> Tanjiro Kamado </strong>  is a kind-hearted and intelligent boy who lives with his family in the mountains. He became his family's breadwinner after his father's death, making trips to the nearby village to sell charcoal. Everything changed when he came home one day to discover that his family was attacked and slaughtered by a demon. Tanjiro and his sister Nezuko were the sole survivors of the incident, with Nezuko being transformed into a demon, but still surprisingly showing signs of human emotion and thought. After an encounter with Giyū Tomioka, a demon slayer, Tanjiro is recruited by Giyū and sent to his retired master Sakonji Urokodaki for training to also become a demon slayer, beginning his quest to help his sister turn into human again and avenge the death of his family.
    After two years of strenuous training, Tanjiro takes part in a formidable exam and is one of the few survivors to pass, officially making him a member of the Demon Slayer Corps. He begins his work of hunting down and slaying demons alongside Nezuko, who has been hypnotized to bring no harm to humans and who occasionally helps him in battle. One of Tanjiro's assignments brings him to Asakusa where he encounters Muzan Kibutsuji, the progenitor of all demons and the one who murdered his family. He also meets Tamayo, a demon who is free of Muzan's control. Tamayo allies with Tanjiro and begins to develop a cure for Nezuko, though it will require Tanjiro to supply her with blood from the Twelve Kizuki, the most powerful demons under Muzan's command.
</p>
    <p> Continuing his missions, Tanjiro meets Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira, fellow survivors of the exam with whom he forms an unlikely team. The group soon face off against a member of the Kizuki, but are ultimately outmatched; they are rescued by the Corps and brought back to headquarters. There, the Kamado siblings partake in a council between Kagaya Ubuyashiki, the leader of the Demon Slayer Corps, and the Hashira, the Corps' most elite members, who do not believe that Nezuko should be allowed to live. However, Kagaya nonetheless manages to convince them to accept her. With this agreement, Tanjiro begins to work alongside the Hashira, where he encounters significantly more resistance from the demons. Alongside the Hashira and Corps members,
        Tanjiro takes part in numerous harrowing battles against the Kizuki, which they survive by narrow margins. During the fray, it is discovered that Nezuko is invulnerable to sunlight, a discovery that makes her the prime target of Muzan, who has long sought a way to overcome the sun and thus become the ultimate being. </p>
