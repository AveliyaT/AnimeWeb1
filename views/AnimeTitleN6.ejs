<h3><p><strong>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood </strong> (Japanese: 鋼の錬金術師 FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST, Hepburn: Hagane no Renkinjutsushi) is a Japanese anime television
    series adapted from the original Fullmetal Alchemist manga series by Hiromu Arakawa. Produced by Bones, the series is directed by Yasuhiro Irie, written by Hiroshi Ōnogi
    and composed by Akira Senju. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the second anime television series based on the manga, with the first being 2003's Fullmetal Alchemist. Unlike the previous adaptation, Brotherhood is a faithful adaptation that directly follows the entire storyline of the original manga.
    The series ran for 64 episodes on MBS–TBS from April 2009 to July 2010.</p>
    <p>In 2006, the Animax channel aired the anime series of the same name, a 26-episode adaptation of the manga created by Bones.</p></h3>
<h2> <em>General plot</em> </h2></h3>

<h3><p>The genres are comedy, romance, high-school, shoujo </p>
<h3><p>After a horrific alchemy experiment goes wrong in the Elric household, brothers Edward and Alphonse are left in a catastrophic new reality. Ignoring the alchemical
    principle banning human transmutation, the boys attempted to bring their recently deceased mother back to life. Instead, they suffered brutal personal loss: Alphonse's
    body disintegrated while Edward lost a leg and then sacrificed an arm to keep Alphonse's soul in the physical realm by binding it to a hulking suit of armor. </p>
    <p> The brothers are rescued by their neighbor Pinako Rockbell and her granddaughter Winry. Known as a bio-mechanical engineering prodigy, Winry creates prosthetic limbs for
        Edward by utilizing "automail," a tough, versatile metal used in robots and combat armor. After years of training, the Elric brothers set
        off on a quest to restore their bodies by locating the Philosopher's Stone—a powerful gem that allows an alchemist to defy the traditional laws of Equivalent Exchange.</p></h3>
<h2><em>Fullmetal Alchemist Was So Popular They Had Two Series</em></h2>
<h3><p><strong>Hosts activities</strong> Given that Fullmetal Alchemist has sold millions after 2003's adaptation, Studio Bones-- Square Enix’s personal animation department-- did a second adaptation from scratch.
    Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood followed closely to the manga and gained a huge success despite the five-year gap between the two series.
</p>
    <p> Arakawa spoke about the original Fullmetal Alchemist, recalling the many meetings overseeing production, and insisted that the studio heads should come up with their interpretation of the series because she didn’t want the readers to see the same ending in the manga.
        Most of the Japanese VAs in Brotherhood replaced the previous actors except Edward and Alphonse. The English VA’s, on the other hand, reprised their roles with the exception of Alphonse, and Maxey Whitebeard replaced Aaron Dismuke because Dislike was too old to play Al.  </p>
