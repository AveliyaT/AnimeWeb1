<h1> Host Club Ouran </h1>
<img src="..//mtrls/Ouran.png" alt="Ouran">

<h3><p><strong>Ouran High School Host Club </strong> (Japanese: 桜蘭高校ホスト部) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Bisco Hatori, and serialized in Hakusensha's LaLa magazine between the September 2002 and November 2010 issues.
    The series follows Haruhi Fujioka, a scholarship student at Ouran Academy, and the other members of the popular host club. The romantic comedy focuses on the relationships within and outside the Club and satirizes the clichés and stereotypes that endure in shōjo manga.</p>
    <p>In 2006, the Animax channel aired the anime series of the same name, a 26-episode adaptation of the manga created by Bones.</p></h3>
<h2> <em>Genres and plot</em> </h2></h3>

<h3><p>The genres are comedy, romance, high-school, shoujo </p>
<h3><p>The comedic series revolves around the escapades of Haruhi Fujioka, a scholarship student at the prestigious Ouran Academy, a fictitious school for rich kids located in Bunkyo,
    Tokyo. Looking for a quiet place to study, Haruhi stumbles upon the abandoned Third Music Room, a place where the Ouran Academy Host Club, a group of six male students, gathers to
    entertain female "clients" with sweets and tea. During their initial encounter, Haruhi accidentally destroys an antique vase valued at ¥8,000,000 (around US$80,000) and must work off
    the debt as the club's errand boy. </p>
    <p> Her short hair, slouching attire, and gender-ambiguous face cause her to be mistaken by the Hosts for a male student, though they soon realize her
    actual gender and the fact that she's a "natural" in entertaining girls, promoting her to full-Host status.</p></h3>
<h2><em>Out of main storyline</em></h2>
<h3><p><strong>Hosts activities</strong> The Hosts usually have a theme and different club activities each day. The Hosts have different "types" and "techniques" to entertain their guests, the most typical of which is cosplay and hosting a tea-and-conversation service, though tea-and-flirting is preferred by its guests.
    The Club also has an active website where updates about events, photos and online auctions may be viewed. A members-only blog is run by Kyoya, and its exclusive information is not available to anyone else, not even the school newspaper.
</p>
    <p> Guests sign up for a time slot with their designated hosts. Based on availability, they can either sign up as a group or for one-on-one time. Regular customers actually learn quite a lot about fine art and Japanese history by attending.
        The club primarily caters to the high school sector of Ouran Academy, but there are hosts in other grades. For example, Shiro Takaoji, an elementary student,
        and Honey and Mori host regularly even after graduating from the high school whilst in attendance at Ouran University.  </p>
