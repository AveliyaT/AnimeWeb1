<h1> One-Punch Man </h1>
<img src="..//mtrls/One-Punch_Man_Logo.png" width="800" height="450" alt="OPM">

<h3><p><strong> One-Punch Man </strong> (Japanese: ワンパンマン, Hepburn: Wanpanman) is a Japanese superhero franchise created by the artist ONE. It tells the story of Saitama,
    a superhero who can defeat any opponent with a single punch but seeks to find a worthy opponent after growing bored by a lack of challenge due to his overwhelming strength. ONE wrote the original webcomic version in early 2009.</p>
    <p>Once released in the United States, both the first and second volumes debuted on the New York Times Manga Best Sellers list, at first and second place, respectively, and stayed there for two weeks. </p></h3>

<h2> <em>Genres and plot</em> </h2></h3>

<h3><p> <strong>The genres are action, comedy, superhero. </strong> </p>
<h3><p>On a super continent Earth, powerful monsters and villains have been wreaking havoc in the cities. In response, the millionaire Agoni creates the Hero Association, which employs superheroes to fight evil. Saitama, an unassociated hero,
    hails from City Z and performs heroic deeds as a hobby. He has trained himself to the point of being able to defeat any enemy with a single punch, but his unmatched strength has left him with an overwhelming sense of boredom. Saitama eventually
    becomes a reluctant mentor to Genos, a cyborg seeking revenge against another cyborg who killed his family and destroyed his hometown. Saitama and Genos join the Hero Association,
    but due to scoring low on the written entry exam, Saitama is placed at a low-entry rank, and his feats remain unnoticed and unappreciated by the public.</p>
    <p> In the aftermath of the battle, the Hero Association's poor performance leads to public opinion of them plummeting. Several heroes and officials decide to retire or defect to the Neo Heroes, a burgeoning rival group that appears to be more effective in
        handling the growing monster threats with its larger membership and the leadership of the hero Blue, who claims to be the son of the long-missing Blast.</p></h3>
<h2><em>Out of main storyline</em></h2>
<h3><p><strong> About the main protagonist</strong> Saitama is an ordinary-looking bald man with a thin but well-built physique and is of average height and weight. He used to have a full
    head of short black hair but lost it due to the intensity of his hero training regimen.
</p>
    <p> Saitama is an indifferent person. Even the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, so he does not take his hero work seriously, goes through everything with little to no effort, and yearns for an opponent that can provide him with a challenge. The lack of worthy opponents has led him to suffer from a
        self-imposed existential crisis, and he claims that his ability to feel any and all emotions has dulled considerably.
        The combination of his attitude, unstoppable power, and "unimpressive" appearance often causes his battles to become anticlimactic. Saitama will usually allow his opponents to rant about their motives and power up into their strongest forms, before obliterating them with a single punch.  </p>
